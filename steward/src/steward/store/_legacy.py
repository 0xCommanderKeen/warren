"""The durable store behind steward's API: jobs, approvals, and the request log.

One SQLite file (``.steward/state/steward.db``, next to the scheduler's own state)
holds everything the API must remember across a restart. SQLite rather than a JSON
file because the two things stored here both need a *conditional* write to be atomic:
the job board's claim (steward #6) is ``UPDATE … WHERE status = 'open'``, and an
approval decision (steward #10) is ``UPDATE … WHERE status = 'pending'`` — the first
writer wins and every later one reads back what was recorded. A read-modify-write over
a JSON file cannot promise that, and "two residents both hold task 7" is exactly the
kind of lie this project refuses to tell.

Nothing here emits, renders, or decides. It records facts and hands them back:

- ``jobs`` — posted work, with the status the board reports. A row with an ``assignee``
  is work one resident handed to another (:mod:`steward.delegation`): the same table,
  because a delegated item is a task addressed to somebody rather than to the fleet, and
  everything the board already does to a task — leasing it, sweeping it, closing it —
  applies to it unchanged.
- ``approvals`` — a gated action waiting on a human, and the decision it received.
- ``requests`` — every accepted mutating API request and how it turned out, so a
  queued action that later failed is traceable rather than silently gone.
- ``run_ledger`` — one row per finished session, with the tokens, money, and seconds it
  actually cost. This is what makes a daily budget survive a daemon restart: a cap that
  resets because the process bounced is not a cap (steward #8).
- ``budget_pauses`` — the residents steward has stopped firing, and the number that
  stopped them. One row per paused resident, inserted conditionally, which is what makes
  "exactly one knock at the door" true rather than hoped for.
- ``watchdog_attempts`` / ``watchdog_passes`` / ``unbracketed_runs`` — what the watchdog
  has already done, so a restart budget and a "run never reported back" complaint are
  each spent exactly once however often the watchdog ticks.
- ``open_runs`` — one row per session steward has started and not yet closed. The
  watchdog reads this to find runs that never reported back, instead of reading the
  undelivered-event log, which can only answer for the host that fired them and only
  while burrow was unreachable (steward #39). It is also where a session's own scoped
  credential lives, as a digest: the run's lease is the credential's expiry, so
  :meth:`Store.session_principal` accepts one exactly while the watchdog could not yet
  bury the run (steward #41).
- ``resident_claims`` — one row per resident saying which process is currently running a
  session for it. The scheduler's overlap guard used to be an in-process lock, which the
  API, the board and a chat daemon could not see; this is the same guard in the one place
  every firing process can read (warren#111). :mod:`steward.claims` owns what it means.
